## General info
<<<<<<< fe
Add more general information about project. What the purpose of the project is? Motivation?
=======
The purpose of this blogger is to create a place where people can use it to share love, thoughts, experience and anything that makes a day.
I created this website mainly because I found even a few single words would make me feel relax and calm after a whole day busying working or studying.
With this easy and clean tool, we could record what we have seen and heard in our own way.
